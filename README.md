### customise and order a delicious burger on our space station

This application was created as a Yandex.Praktikum React-dev course study project

Demo: https://ev-shamko.github.io/react-stellar-burgers

## Functionality

* use drag and drop to create your own delicios burger 
* you can get the list of ingridients from API and post an order

* you can create an account, authorise or restore password
* quick and comfortable single page routing

## Technologies
React CRA, Redux, TypeScript, WebSocket, Cypress, Jest, Webpack, React DND, React Router DOM <br>
This application is connected to public API. If API seems not working (no ingridients data, authorisation fails) please inform me.

## Installation
`git clone`<br>
`npm i`<br>
For guaranteed result use NPM v6.14.* and Node v14.17.* <br>
However more resent versions of npm and node probably should do fine.

## How to run the app

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

## Testing

### Redux testing:

### To run Cypress UI-tests: 
Functionality of creating order and authorisation pro—Åess can be tested with Cypress. It is really usefull, important for drag and drop automatic testing, also it looks very cool.
